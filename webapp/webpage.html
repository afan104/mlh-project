<h1>Eye-Tracking Mouse</h1>
<!-- short description -->
<p>Eye-tracking mouse is a system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eyes. This technology uses a camera to track the user's eye movements and translates them into cursor movements on the screen. It can be used as an assistive technology for people with disabilities or as a hands-free input method for users who are unable to use a traditional mouse.</p>
